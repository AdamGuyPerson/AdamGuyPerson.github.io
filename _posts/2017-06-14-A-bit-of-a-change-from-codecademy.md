Today Mr. Ampah-Korsah wasn't in school so we had a cover teacher. Despite this, Mr. Keen, who was in the neighbouring room took his class into our classroom and had a talk about how you could code a machine to make tea, for instance move hand to the kettle handle and grab it...etc. it eventually ended with us looking at the internet craze, "the dress" in which people saw it as different colours. This made us think that whatever colour we see, might not be the same as someone elses, for instance what we were taught was green might be what I see as green but for your green, you might see purple, but we donâ€™t think these colours are odd as this is what we are taught are colours.
