    <td>This lesson I grouped in with Michael, Josh and George and we all helped each other in any way we could to get through each go. Even if Michael had done it before, he still found it quite hard doing it for a second time so it helped him be reminded of previous activities.</td>

    <td>We had to stop during the lesson to see our blogs again and because it was a while since we last did this, we looked at others to see which ones we shouldn't impersonate and which ones we should. I do need to work on my memory from previous activities to apply later on and so I can remember how to edit my blog properly. I also need to write more in this format.</td>

    <td>I will make my blog look better and make sure my blog is a supreme role model for the other students meaning that I won’t have to worry about much more than writing a blog each week. I should also help Josh as he’s 1 or 2 behind me so those activities are fresh in my brain. I also shouldn’t be afraid to ask the teacher for help when I desperately need it and none of my fellow pupils can work it out either.</td>
