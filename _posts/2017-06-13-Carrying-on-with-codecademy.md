**Title**: Carrying on with Codecademy

**Starting poin**t: 11%

**Aim for the lesson**: 16%

**Did I reach my target?**: Yes, exactly 16%

**Lesson Review**:

**How did I learn, what strategies were effective?**

I found that I could always talk to Michael, next to me if I ever got stuck with my work. I did however use the hints as they made sure I knew what I was doing.

**What limited my learning, what habits do I need to work on?**

I need to get into the idea of remembering all of the commands to keep a quick pace.

**What will i change for next time, how will I improve my learning?**

I should not be afraid to ask questions from my peers or from my teacher
