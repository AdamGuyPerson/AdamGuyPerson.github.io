    <td>We were taught the tools to make a grid and also how to change the colour of a box. I didn't finish because I couldn't remember how to do the prices including the quantities and the range, however I did find how to make sums and products. I need to work on the sheet at home until it is finished.</td>

    <td>I found it difficult to remember how to make a total price and to get only one row in British pounds sterling. And how to use the range and so I should find a way to remember the instructions.</td>

    <td>I could note down the instructions and then add them to the bottom of each blog post. I could also ask the people next to me or the teacher to repeat the instructions and then I do it.</td>
