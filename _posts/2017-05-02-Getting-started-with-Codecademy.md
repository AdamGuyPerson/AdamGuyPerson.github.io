**Getting started with Codecademy**

This was our first lesson on Codecademy and I think I made an excellent start, achieving six badges in the first lesson including the 'ten exercises' badge along with the ‘tip calculator’ badge. Having barrelled along in the first lesson meant that in lessons to come I would be able to take time on future tasks that proved difficult. Overall in the lesson I overcame about 24 Exercises.

I enjoyed using the software as it told you when something went wrong and would give you a reason why and would only let you carry on if you got it right. The software also reused knowledge that could be used in future lessons and exercises, training our minds not to forget these strategies
