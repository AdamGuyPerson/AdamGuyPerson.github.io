**Title:** Getting further into Codecademy

**Starting point:** 16%

**Aim for the lesson:** 21%

**Did you reach your target?:** Yes, 1% above it.

**Lesson Review:**

**How did I learn, what strategies were effective?**

Today we looked over the blogs for most of the lesson, Mr. Ampah-Korsah went through each blog and gave points for improvement. 

**What limited my learning, what habits do I need to work on?**

I am not quite sure how to add a box and an image as a background and also my blog has huge gaps between each line which I don't know how to fix.

**What will i change for next time, how will I improve my learning?**

I should make my blog more aesthetically pleasing in terms of colours background and layout of text.
