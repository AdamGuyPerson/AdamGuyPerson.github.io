**Title: **Trundling along with codecademy

**Starting point: **22%

**Aim for the lesson: **25%

**Did I reach my target? **Not quite, I got to 24%

**Lesson Review:**

**How did I learn, what strategies were effective?**

Today I got a bit stuck on one of the questions but I applied my knowledge and asked Michael for some help and he fixed me on the right track. Thanks, Mike!

**What limited my learning, what habits do I need to work on?**

I forgot what I did from two weeks ago so I didn't have much of a flow.

**What will I change for next time, how will I improve my learning?**

I should find how to get rid of the big gaps between lines on my blog.
