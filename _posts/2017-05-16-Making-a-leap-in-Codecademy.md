This time, I made a lot of progress, I truly did make a leap in Codecademy. However, the further along you get, the less badges that come up, this is because at the start you would get a badge for completing your first lesson and completing one question. I may be uploading my blogs in bulk today as before as my posts folder disappeared do I chose to create a new blog, in which using Barry Clark - Jekyll now is incredibly easy to use and convenient to create posts on.
